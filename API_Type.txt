"""
    The provided code (main.py) is for a **RESTful API**. Here's why:

    - Elements that point towards a RESTful API:

    1. HTTP Methods:
    The code uses Flask's `@app.route` decorator with different methods like
    GET (implicit in the route definition) to handle requests to various API endpoints (`/api/v1/...`).


    2. Resource Identification:
    The API uses URLs to identify specific resources
    (temperature data for a station and date or all data for a station).

      - For example: `/api/v1/123456/2023-07-04` targets temperature data for station 123456 on date 2023-07-04.


    3. Standard HTTP Status Codes:
    While not explicitly shown in this code snippet,
    RESTful APIs typically use standard HTTP status codes for responses
    (200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.).


    4. Uniform Interface:
    The API uses a consistent approach to handle data access using GET requests at different endpoints.


    5. Looking for confirmation?
    The best way to confirm if it's intended to be a fully RESTful API is to check the accompanying documentation for the code.
    If the documentation mentions adherence to REST principles and details API functionalities
    using HTTP methods and URLs, it solidifies it as a RESTful API.
